# R for Reproducibility


```{r, include = FALSE}
ottrpal::set_knitr_image_path()
```

## Learning Objectives

Before we begin to jump into additional tools that R can help us with to be work more efficiently and in a more reproducible manner, it is helpful to first discuss why we should consider R in the first place. After completing this section you will be able to:

- Explain why R can be especially helpful for transparent and reproducibility data analyses
- Recognize that R has a very active and supportive community and locate access points to that community
- Compare R to other similar statistical and data analysis tools and programming languages
- Describe the unique benefits of R

## Why R

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Major point!! example image"}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MNHf8JpolaEP_vQ_kB-1xRBF9wo3haCArRu117hBoHA/edit#slide=id.g21a84b32106_0_9")
