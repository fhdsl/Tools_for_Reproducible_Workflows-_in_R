[["index.html", "Tools for Reproducible Workflows in R About this Course 0.1 Available course formats", " Tools for Reproducible Workflows in R March, 2023 About this Course Reproducibility of data analyses can be enhanced through the use of tools designed to manage the complexity involved in any data analysis designed to address an important scientific question. We focus on a few software tools that aid in project organization, collaboration, auditability of analyses, and maintaining the integrity of data and code. In this course, we view a data analysis as a complex system with many integrated parts that together produce analytic results. The tools we focus on here allow data analysts to diagnose unexpected results, quickly identify problems with data and code, and provide a basis for managing the dynamic nature of data analysis.

"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.2 Target Audience 1.3 Curriculum 1.4 Learning Objectives", " Chapter 1 Introduction In this course we will explore a variety of tools that can assist with data analysis from a broad range of fields. The tools we will cover may take some time to get used to, but the payoff will be immeasurable. Not only are these skills valuable for career advancement, they will also make your work-life easier. The tools will enhance your ability to reproduce your work across similar projects, stay organized, collaborate with others effectively, and more. 1.1 Motivation Many researchers are self-taught when it comes to computer science. However, data analysis has become a requirement for most researchers. The ability to smoothly work in a reproducible manner not only makes for easier more maintainable workflows, it also improves scientific rigor and transparency. This course will help learners to use tools that will make their data analytic workflows more organized, more understandable to collaborators (and your future self!), and ultimately more efficient. 1.2 Target Audience This course is intended for people conducting data analyses at the level of a graduate student or higher. The course is designed so that the majority of the material is presented in a high-level manner that should be applicable to researchers working in a broad range of areas. The course is centered around the R programming language, a widely used statistical analysis software package. 1.3 Curriculum The course covers… 1.4 Learning Objectives Implement basic project organization tools: R Studio tips and tricks for efficiency R Markdown to create reports Setup and configure RStudio/RStudio projects for data analysis (here package and file structure/paths) Install and configure ProjectTemplate package for formalizing and automating workflows Apply the pointblank package for validation of tabular data Write functions and package them Apply the testthat package for building software unit tests Setup and use Git repositories for version control of code Interface with GitHub to share Git repositories for collaboration; execute GitHub-based workflows Pull Requests Code review Issues Discussions References will include Gillespie and Lovelace (2021), Riederer (2020), Timbers, Campbell, and Lee (2022). Code review references will include “About Scientific Code Review” (n.d.), Radigan (n.d.), Parker (2017), Bodner (2018).
