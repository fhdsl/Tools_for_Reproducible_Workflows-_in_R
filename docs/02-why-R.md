# R for Reproducibility




## Learning Objectives

Before we begin to jump into additional tools that R can help us with to be work more efficiently and in a more reproducible manner, it is helpful to first discuss why we should consider R in the first place. After completing this section you will be able to:

- Explain why R can be especially helpful for transparent and reproducibility data analyses
- Recognize that R has a very active and supportive community and locate access points to that community
- Compare R to other similar statistical and data analysis tools and programming languages
- Describe the unique benefits of R
